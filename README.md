# CAT-MATERIALS-2025
Hey there, future 99 percentiler 👋

If you’ve landed here, chances are you’ve felt that familiar mix of ambition, anxiety, and endless “where do I even begin?” that every CAT aspirant goes through.
I’ve been there too.

Throughout my own CAT 2025 journey, I realized how scattered good resources are — hopping between forums, Telegram groups, and coaching sites just to find one decent sectional test or mock. It’s exhausting.

So I decided to change that.

This repository is my small way of paying it forward — a curated collection of sectionals, mock tests, and prep materials from various sources, all organized to make your preparation smoother and self-driven.

Every file here carries hours of effort, frustration, and learning — not just mine, but the shared journey of thousands of CAT aspirants who’ve walked this path before us.

💡 Use these resources wisely.
Push yourself in each of the three sections —

VARC: Read, reflect, and reason.

DILR: Break the puzzle before it breaks you.

QA: Understand, don’t just memorize.

Remember, CAT is not just a test of aptitude — it’s a test of consistency, composure, and courage.

If this repo helps even one person find direction or confidence, it’s worth every bit of effort.

So dive in, stay disciplined, and when you make it to your dream B-school — come back and help someone else who’s just starting out. 🌱
